xplane.js
=========

This is a little experiment to help teach myself more about node.js and UDP. X-Plane, a popular flight simulator, has a veritable firehose of data available via UDP; altitude, airspeed, position, etc. I thought it might be fun to try to collect and do $THING on this data.

N.B. I am not a JavaScript or node.js programmer. This code will probably violate all kinds of lovely standards and might upset your tummy.
